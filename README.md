# Geo-Mapping Tool with Voronoi Diagraming

## Project Overview

We utlized Python and HTML to build a site that creates a Voronoi diagram to highlight regions of interest for translation projects. The Voronoi color codes regions with high percentages of languages with untranslated Bibles, along with listing other factors for users to consider when deciding how to allocate resources to a project if it includes this region. An LLM feature is also included to show Barriers to Entry for the regaion of the hub language selected.
